                            will

                            <li>2. Using an incorrect mobile number or email address will cause delays in getting your
                                e-Transfer. Check your profile under the merchant's site to ensure you have your current

                        <p>If we do not get an undelivered notification, <span>Gigadat</span> will have to cancel the e-Transfer. If

                        <h3>Can I register for Autodeposit?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. The availability of the Autodeposit feature, along with the experience to register, will
                            vary by the financial institution. To register for Interac e-Transfer Autodeposit, log into
                            your online or mobile banking account and go to your Interac e-Transfer profile settings.
                            Once there, add the identifier (email address or text) you want to be associated with
                            Interac e-Transfer Autodeposit and select the account into which you want funds deposited.
                            You will receive a request to verify registration. The next time someone sends funds to the
                            identifier registered, the money will be deposited directly into your account without the
                            need to answer a security question.
